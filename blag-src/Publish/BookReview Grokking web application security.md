Grokking Web Application Security is a solid web app security book. It introduces concepts well and it has a lot of nice diagrams to illustrate concepts. Its also good that its fairly recent. It's not super in depth, it doesn't cover everything and its more of a general overview but it's definitely a solid start. It hits all the common vulnerabilities XSS, SSRF, File Uploads, SQL Injection etc. Even though I know web app security fairly well, I still picked up some new ideas. I would say this book is more beginner oriented but is a fantastic general resource.
